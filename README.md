# Last.fm playlisting app for Spotify

Unofficial Spotify app that builds playlists based on ye olde Last.fm radio
playlisting service.

To install:
* Register with your Spotify account as a developer: https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/
* Create and navigate to `~/Spotify` (OS X, Linux) or `~\Documents\Spotify` (Windows)
* Clone this repository into `spotify-lastfm-playlisting`
* Open Spotify, into the search box type: `spotify:app:spotify-lastfm-playlisting` and press enter

Unfortunately, I believe you'll have to repeat the last step every time you
start Spotify (cf. [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16065247/home-made-spotify-app-disappears-after-restart)).

Warning: App doesn't have any error handling, a pretty UI, or even good code. But
feel free to contribute any of those!

This was based on the helpful [tutorial app](https://github.com/spotify/apps-tutorial).
